Raspberry Pi can query database and show current day's todo so far.

What is next?

Create socket interface so that I can send data from CLI to lua on the raspberry pi
How to run python code required to use the inky screen - they are both scripts so
can automate it in bash

Use - Send data to pi
    - Data is received and db is altered
    - Update message is also sent and screen refresh is triggered

syntax: new date task complete
	update date number task/complete
	remove date number

Further stuff to maybe do
	- Reminders: screen refreshed to reminder page an hour before event, button
	  to dismis and return to todo
	- Some other update: Could do some regular event updates like at 17:00 on
	  a sunday the football scores are printed to screen or anything like that
	- Essentially some button interface could callback to the currennt todo list
