Script sets rpi static IP so that client never has to change socket. Server starts on boot of rpi. On install on client user is prompted to enter rpi's IP - This is stored and port is hardcoded which all together makes for successful connection every time. And add both programs to file so they can be run like this: prs add ...

Pi R-Squared arguments must be in one of the following forms
Arguments in [] are optional

get yyyy-mm-dd

install.sh will run database scripts, add server to startup applications and run server for first time. On client side, install.sh will prompt user for Pi R-Squared's IP address (port is hardcoded) and add script to $PATH so that 'prs' can be called from terminal.
